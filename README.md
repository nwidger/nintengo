## Build

### Mac OS X/Linux/Windows

1. Install Ebiten by following the official
   [installation instructions](https://ebiten.org/documents/install) for your
   platform.

2. `go get -u github.com/nwidger/nintengo`

### WebAssembly

WebAssembly support requires Go 1.11 or higher.

1. Download nintengo

   ```
   go get -d -u github.com/nwidger/nintengo
   ```

2. Build `wasm/nintengo.wasm`

   ```
   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nwidger/nintengo
   GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o wasm/nintengo.wasm .
   ```

3. Start web server running on port 8000

   ```
   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nwidger/nintengo/wasm
   go run serve.go -http :8000
   ```

3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.  Press the `Choose
   File` button and select a `.nes` file to run.

## Support

Audio support is currently a work in progress.  All audio channels are
working in some capacity.

Battery backed saves is implemented and are saved to disk with a
`.sav` file extension.

Save states are supported and are saved to disk with a `.nst` file
extension.

## Netplay

Nintengo includes two-player netplay support using the `-listen` and
`-connect` command-line arguments.  To use, player one launches
nintengo and tells it to listen for incoming connections using the
`-listen` flag:

```
nintengo -listen=:8080 FILE
```

Player two then connects to player one using the `-connect` flag,
providing the server's host/port:

```
nintengo -connect=192.168.1.110:8080
```

Note that player two does not need to provide a `FILE` argument.

## Acknowledgments

This project would not have been possible without the amazing treasure
trove of information that is the
[NESdev Wiki](http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NES_reference_guide)
and the fine folks at `#nesdev` on EFnet.

Being able to read the source code of other NES emulators was also
extremely helpful.  The following is a short list of the ones I
consulted most often, although it is probably not the complete list:

- Fergulator: https://github.com/scottferg/Fergulator/
- Nintendulator: http://www.qmtpro.com/~nes/nintendulator/
- Nestopia: http://nestopia.sourceforge.net/
- Nesalizer (by Ulf Magnusson): https://github.com/ulfalizer/nesalizer
